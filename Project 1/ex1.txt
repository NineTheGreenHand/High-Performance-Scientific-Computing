1. What is the host name of the computer as reported by your linux environment? (You will need to find the right Linux command to execute for this. I suggest searching the web.)

Answer: The host nname is: LAPTOP-FSMG0GF1

2. How would you specify the name of an output file when you use the compiler if you wanted the executable to have a name other than a.out?

Answer: The default output file name is a.out, we can change that by adding “-o outputfile" in the end when we use the compiler.
For example in our case, if we want our output file to be named as "ps1.out", we can use the command "c++ -std=c++11 sin6pi.cpp -o ps1.out".
This will create an output file named as "ps1.out".

3. What happens if you type

$ a.out
instead of

$ ./a.out
to run your program? What is the difference (operationally) between the two statements?

Answer: When we type “a.out”, it gives "a.out: command not found", and “./a.out" gives "Pass -7.34788e-16".
Operationally, "./a.out", the "./" means we search "a.out" in our current working directory. Since in 
the windows environment, there is no "a.out" command, so if we don't add "./" in front, we will get this 
error message.  

4. What does clang print when you run

$ c++ --version

Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin

5. In the example program, the i and N variables are said to be size_t. What is a size_t?

Answer: size_t is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator.
Widely used when representing sizes and counts.
